## Software

The core part of Newrl blockchain is the Newrl Client which is an open source python codebase [Newrl Core](https://github.com/newrlfoundation/newrl)

You do not have to run a Newrl Core node to build on Newrl: you can start developing in your language of choice by installing one of the [Newrl SDKs](#sdks). To find out more about how to interact with Newrl, check out the [API Reference](../.././api/introduction/index.mdx) section, which chronicles every Newrl endpoints.

### Newrl Core

Newrl Core is the backbone of the Newrl network and does the hard work of validating and agreeing on the status of every transaction with other instances of Core through the Proof of Trust Consensus Protocol. The processes for installing, configuring, and maintaining a Stellar Core node are covered in great detail in the [Run a Core Node](../run-core-node/index.mdx) section of the docs.

## SDKs

There are a wide variety of Newrl SDKs, which means you can interact with the network in your language of choice. The Javascript, and Python SDKs are maintained by the Newrl Foundation; the rest are maintained by dedicated community developers. They're all open source, so if you have a question, suggestion, or contribution to make, you can file a Github issue or pull request in the relevant SDK repository. You can also get in touch with SDK maintainers by joining the [Newrl discord channel](https://discord.com/), and navigating to the #sdk-mainteners channel.

Each SDK has its own source code and documentation, and we've linked to both in the list below. Often, the best place to find out how to use a given SDK is to check the documentation specific to it. Most offer practical examples that demonstrate how to construct and submit transactions and interact with Horizon endpoints.

## Tools

The Newrl Development Foundation maintains a small suite of tools to make it easier for developers to interact with the network.

### [Wallet](https://wallet.newrl.net/)

The Newrl wallet is a webapp that allows you to create wallet, transfer tokens and submit transactions etc.

### [Newrl Node Map](http://newrlscanner.herokuapp.com/)

The Newrl Node Map displays the available nodes on the network along with the current miner and committee status. This can be useful to find and use nodes.

### [Dashboard](http://dashboard.newrl.net)

The dashboard shows the current status of the public network and the test network.

### [Newrl Scanner](https://scanner.newrl.net/)

Newrl Scanner is a platform to view the recent transactions, blocks etc on the chain realtime and to query the chain for past events.
